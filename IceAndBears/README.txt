A simple game about polar bears digging for firewood and shelter by Rhys Maxwell (programming and sprites) and Sarah Zollino (background art).

To play hit the left or right arrowkey to dig with that respective bear. If a rock is in the way of the chosen bear, the bear cannot dig the snow and
you lose. Your goal is to find snow with logs burried in the middle and add the logs to the furnace with the up arrow key, careful not to run out
of fuel though!
